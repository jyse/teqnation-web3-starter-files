💠 Introduction of Solidity

💻 license always at the top 
💻 always a version of solidity at the top 
💻 imports so you can use different kinds of standards of contracts 
💻 contract word is like a class and “is ERC721”, means that this contract inherits functionality from the ERC721 and is like it. 
💻 for variables types are always used, like string or an unsigned integer whereby 256 represents that this integer will take up 256 bits of space in memory. 
💻 if you see something with the word using - it means: using A for B, it means that we attach every function from library A in this case Counters, to type B Counter.
💻 Counters is then used to set the _tokenIdCounter which is a private variable 
💻 constructor, is like a classic constructor and to make this contract with the name of DevBots and the symbol token you see very often on OpenSea. 
💻 private, internal or public all have to do with the accessibility of the function - how much you can see or retrieve from the blockchain. 
💻 string memory means, this string comes back from a temporary memory - so this won’t cost so much gas fees - or not at all.
